												<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)<br>
Since the invention of HTML, styles have come in various forms. With the growth of HTML, HTML has added a lot of display capabilities to meet the needs of page designers. But as these capabilities increase, HTML becomes more cluttered. So CSS was born.<br>
In 1994, Ha Khun Lee made the first suggestion of CSS. When Bert Bos was designing a browser called Argo, they decided to design CSS together.<br>
In fact, at that time, there was already some suggestion for a unified style sheet language in the Internet community, but CSS was the first style sheet language to contain the "layered" meaning. In CSS, the style of a file can be inherited from other stylesheets. Readers can use his favorite style in some places, or inherit or "layer" the author's style elsewhere.<br>
In the same year, the W3C (World WideWeb Consortium) was established. All CSS creators became W3C's working groups and are fully committed to developing CSS standards. The development of cascading style sheets is finally on the right track.¡£<br>
Programming Tools<br>
Notepad: use Windows system comes with notepad can edit web pages. Only need to save the document to. Html suffix name can be saved.<br>
Dreamweaver: It and Flash, Fireworks and said the page Three Musketeers. Dreamweaver is a WYSIWYG webpage editor for web-authoring and administration. It is the first visual web-development tool developed specifically for professional web designers, making it easy to create vibrant web pages.<br>
Language features editor<br>
CSS provides a style description for the HTML markup language that defines how the elements are displayed. CSS is a breakthrough in the field of web design. It can be used to modify a small style to update all the page elements associated with it. In general, CSS has the following features:<br>
Rich style definition<br>
CSS provides a rich document style look and feel and the ability to set text and background properties; allows you to create a border for any element, as well as the distance between the element's border and other elements, as well as the distance between the element's border and the element's content; allows you to change the text at will Case, modifier, and other page effects. Easy to use and modify
CSS can define a style in the style attribute of an HTML element, define it in the header section of an HTML document, or declare the style in a special CSS file for reference to an HTML page.
Multi-page application CSS style sheets can be stored separately in a CSS file, so that we can use the same CSS style sheet in multiple pages. CSS style sheets theoretically do not belong to any page file, in any page file can be referenced. This can be achieved more than one page style unity.<br>
Cascading<br>
Simply put, cascade is to set the same style multiple times for an element, which will use the last set of attribute values. For example, if you use the same set of CSS stylesheets for multiple pages in a site, and some of the elements in some pages want to use other styles, you can define a single stylesheet for each of these styles to apply to the page.<br>
Page compression<br>
Web sites that use HTML to define page effects often require large or repetitive forms and font elements to create a variety of text styles, which can result in a large number of HTML tags resulting in an increase in the size of the page file. Putting the style declaration separately into a CSS style sheet can greatly reduce the size of the page so that the time it takes to load the page is greatly reduced.
CSS is a language that defines style structures such as fonts, colors, locations, etc. It is used to describe how information is formatted and realistic on web pages. CSS styles can be stored directly in HTML pages or as a single style sheet.<br>
Style rules are formatting instructions that can be applied to elements in web pages, such as text paragraphs or links. Style rules consist of one or more style attributes and their values. The internal style sheets are placed directly on the web page, the external style sheets are stored in separate documents, and the web pages link to external style sheets through a special label.<br>
Selector<br>
Type selector<br>
A selector in CSS is the name of the element type. Using this selector, called a type selector, you can apply a claim to each instance of this element type. For example, the selector for the simple rule below is H1, so the rules apply to all H1 elements in the document:<br>
1<br>
H1 <br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: red<br>}<br>
